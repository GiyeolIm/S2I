# Installation

##### Using `go get`

You can install the s2i binary using `go get` which will download the source-to-image code into your `$GOPATH`, build the s2i binary, and install it into your `$GOPATH/bin`.

```
$ go get github.com/openshift/source-to-image/cmd/s2i
```

##### For Mac

You can either follow the installation instructions for Linux (and use the darwin-amd64 link) or you can just install source-to-image with Homebrew:

```
$ brew install source-to-image
```

##### For Linux

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases/latest) page and download the correct distribution for your machine. Choose either the linux-386 or the linux-amd64 links for 32 and 64-bit, respectively.

Unpack the downloaded tar with

`$ tar -xvf release.tar.gz`.

You should now see an executable called s2i. Either add the location of s2i to your PATH environment variable, or move it to a pre-existing directory in your PATH. For example,

```
# cp /path/to/s2i /usr/local/bin
```

will work with most setups.

##### For Windows

Download the latest [64-bit Windows release](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases/latest). Extract the zip file through a file browser. Add the extracted directory to your PATH. You can now use s2i from the command line.

Note: We have had some reports of Windows Defender falsely alerting reporting that the Windows binaries contain "Trojan:Win32/Azden.A!cl". This appears to be a common false alert for other applications as well.

##### From source

Assuming Go and Docker are installed and configured, execute the following commands:

```
$ go get github.com/openshift/source-to-image
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/openshift/source-to-image
$ export PATH=$PATH:${GOPATH}/src/github.com/openshift/source-to-image/_output/local/bin/linux/amd64/
$ hack/build-go.sh
```



# Security

Since the `s2i` command uses the Docker client library, it has to run in the same security context as the `docker` command. For some systems, it is enough to add yourself into the 'docker' group to be able to work with Docker as 'non-root'. In the latest versions of Fedora/RHEL, it is recommended to use the `sudo` command as this way is more auditable and secure.

If you are using the `sudo docker` command already, then you will have to also use `sudo s2i` to give S2I permission to work with Docker directly.

Be aware that being a member of the 'docker' group effectively grants root access, as described [here](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9976).



# Getting Started

You can start using `s2i` right away (see [releases](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases)) with the following test sources and publicly available images:

```
$ s2i build https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world centos/ruby-25-centos7 test-ruby-app
$ docker run --rm -i -p :8080 -t test-ruby-app
$ s2i build --ref=10.x --context-dir=helloworld https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart openshift/wildfly-101-centos7 test-jee-app
$ docker run --rm -i -p 8080:8080 -t test-jee-app
```
