# Using Source-To-Image (S2I) on Linux

Now that we have installed the S2I tool, we can consider a simple example of how it can be used to build your images with applications. For simplicity, we’ll use [Software Collections S2I](https://github.com/sclorg) repository which contains pre-created templates for many applications.



Our example is for Nginx web server. Let’s clone the repository with Dockerfiles for Nginx images for OpenShift. You can choose between RHEL and CentOS based images.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/nginx-container.git
```

Change to Nginx version folder.

```
cd nginx-container
git submodule update --init
cd 1.12
```

For using other versions of Nginx, just replace the **1.12** value by particular version in the commands above.



### **Files and Directories in the repository**

| File                   | Required? | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dockerfile             | Yes       | Defines the base builder image                               |
| s2i/bin/assemble       | Yes       | Script that builds the application                           |
| s2i/bin/usage          | No        | Script that prints the usage of the builder                  |
| s2i/bin/run            | Yes       | Script that runs the application                             |
| s2i/bin/save-artifacts | No        | Script for incremental builds that saves the built artifacts |
| test/run               | No        | Test script for the builder image                            |
| test/test-app          | Yes       | Test application source code                                 |

Once you have the repository locally, create a CentOS 7 builder image named *nginx-centos7*.

```
docker build -t nginx-centos7 .
```



### Creating the application image

The application image combines the builder image with your applications source code, which is served using whatever application is installed via the *Dockerfile*, compiled using the *assemble* script, and run using the *run* script.

You can use the created image as a base to build a simple [sample-app](https://github.com/sclorg/nginx-container/tree/master/1.12/test/test-app) application that can be run on Openshift Container platform. The following command will create the application image:

```
$ cd nginx-container/1.12
$ s2i build test/test-app nginx-centos7 nginx-centos7-app
 ---> Installing application source
 ---> Copying nginx.conf configuration file…
 './nginx.conf' -> '/etc/opt/rh/rh-nginx112/nginx/nginx.conf'
 ---> Copying nginx configuration files…
 './nginx-cfg/default.conf' -> '/opt/app-root/etc/nginx.d/default.conf'
 ---> Copying nginx default server configuration files…
 './nginx-default-cfg/alias.conf' -> '/opt/app-root/etc/nginx.default.d/alias.conf'
 ---> Copying nginx start-hook scripts…
 Build completed successfully
```

Using the logic defined in the *assemble* script, s2i will now create an application image using the builder image as a base and including the source code from the test/test-app directory.

Check to confirm you have application image created.

```
$ docker images | grep nginx-centos7-app
nginx-centos7-app              latest              59cbe8e707c7        About a minute ago   320MB
```

Run the application image by invoking the docker run command:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 nginx-centos7-app
```

The application deployed consists of a simple static web page and it should be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
